# iFrameTV
A single page website completely written in the DOM & BOM. With dynamic filters and search. This was my first large website I created to help teach myself javascript. It is nice but the you can tell some of the code written might be functional but could be written a lot cleaner. How it works is when you click on a image it would call the file source from google docs and wrap it in a iFrame which will overlay the index page. Then clicking the "X" button will close the iframe bringing you back to the filters and search state you where just using. Whats neat about this is you're not storing or paying for the data directly. The down side is the data is not stable and can be changed or deleted.
